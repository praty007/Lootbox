<h1>Object Oriented Lootbox System for Unity</h1>

I wanted to create a basic Lootbox system that uses Object Oriented Programming concepts to handle most data operations within non-monobehaviours.
This is just the first draft of the code and it will see some major refactoring.

You may choose to use it in your project now or after the refactoring. For now, all you need to do is attach LootboxDemo component to a GameObject in your scene. After which, you'll need to assign appropriate Buttons to all the SerializedFields. All other required scripts will be automatically added and Buttons will update to reflect the latest values.
The UI is shit in the sample scene but it shows how the project works.

Possible feature additions in the future:
<li>Use codegen to streamline Lootboxes. So it really becomes just simple a drag and drop plugin.</li>
<li>Make the project more Object Oriented and Optimized (Suggestions and constructive criticism welcome).</li>
<li>An inventory system to go with the Lootbox System, complete with codegen as well.</li>
